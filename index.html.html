                <h1><u>RISE AND FALL OF WHATSAPP FOUNDER:</u></h1>
            </center>
            <p>WhatsApp the American social media app famously used for doing chat, video call, posting status, sending photos, videos and documents, voice call, payment in all over the world. Almost 5 billion plus people use WhatsApp. But from Asian country WhatsApp has got more attention comparing to others. Now let’s discuss about the history of WhatsApp and one of the founder Jan Koum. </p>
            <p>WhatsApp’s parent company is Facebook inc. All the famous social media website like Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. are run by single social media ruler company named Facebook inc. WhatsApp was coded by two great programmers Brian Acton and Jan Koum and was launched on 2009 AD on iOS and later launched on android. It was growing too much during those days and was making lots of profit during those few couple of years. Before WhatsApp, softwares like We Chat, Skype were famously used as chatting.</p>
            <p>But the history or background of one of the WhatsApp founder Jan Koum is known by only few people. Jan was born on Soviet Union on extremely poor family. His father died just when he was child of 7 years. And later, Jan’s mother and Jan went to California in search of job. They were too poor that they sometimes even can’t afford the food for twice a day has to sleep with an empty stomach. They should stand on a queue for the food where the government used to provide the food for the poor family. Jan was crazy on computers.  He used to play games on his friend’s computers, he used to solve the problems of his friends on computer. His mom was suffering from breast cancer he knew it later and when he was 12 years old her mom also died because of breast cancer. </p>
            <p>It can be cured in an initial stage but it was too costly which they can’t afford and that cancer took her life. Now Jan was alone 12 years old kid in the massive big city. When Jan used to feel depressed his friends used to call him to their home and make him busy so that the feeling of depression may be reduced from his mind. Till 3 years he can’t erase all the memory of him mom from his mind.</p>
            <p>After few years Jan and his friend Brian went to Yahoo in search of job. They worked there for few months and they left the job. Their dream was to work on social media ruler company Facebook so they went to apply on Facebook but they both were brutally kicked out from Facebook and they were insulted from Facebook badly. Now those two boys decided to build their own empire and to take a revenge to all those company who had kicked them.</p>
            <p>As we know, Jan was crazy on computers. So, they went to a computer cyber and they learnt programming from the cyber. Now they started a project named WhatsApp used for chatting because it sounds like What’s Up. Just after few months they launched WhatsApp officially on iOS for doing experiment. At the beginning launched of WhatsApp on iOS they didn’t get expected number of users and users were in limited numbers and WhatsApp used to be crash during chatting and users weren’t happy seeing it. At first Jan was completely demotivated and he even said to Brian that “Our project is failed, let’s search for a job instead of hanging on this, it is not getting more attention. Let’s quit the company, we are just wasting our time and money. Let’s search a job!!”. But thanks to Brian that he motivated to Jan and told him to let’s fix the problem instead of giving up and wait for more few months, they did as much as they can do and they tried to fix the bugs and after few days of re-launched of bugs free WhatsApp, Apple also launched push notification features on iPhone then climax came here, WhatsApp’s users graph suddenly moved up and was used by almost 60% of iOS user and 250,000+ users at that time. It wasn’t launched on android so by seeing successful growth of WhatsApp favored by every user and user’s review were also good which motivated then and they launched WhatsApp on android and after few years they launched on Windows, Mac, and on other operating system. From their Jan, Brian and their company never looked back.</p>
            <p>After that, WhatsApp had received many users in very little time. Those days Skype, G-Chat were used as chatting but when WhatsApp was launched in android and windows operating system. Skype, G-chat were destroyed. G-chat was owned by Google, although it was owned by Google it went to a million dollars of loss. Skype also loosed millions of users but it was owned by Microsoft so it wasn’t affected too much on that company. But at that time many others application and website were used as chatting they were totally closed.</p>
            <p>WhatsApp was growing too much fasts in low time. People loves to hang on WhatsApp than that of Facebook. So, Facebook’s founder and CEO decided to buy WhatsApp so that their companies also won’t be affected. Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg watched the WhatsApp growth and immediately bought WhatsApp in 2014 on $19 billion with 600 million users. And, now its net revenue is $60 billion and 5 billion plus users.</p>
            <p>Jan and Brian also took a sweet revenge on Facebook and, they were the part of the company Facebook company till 2016. Few years before they were kicked off from Facebook and few years later, they sold a company to Facebook and that’s called revenge. Everyday 500 million active users use WhatsApp and around 70 billion messages will be sent daily on WhatsApp. They both are obviously billionaire now with $10 billion net worth. </p>
            <p>From growing with poverty family who don’t even can’t erase their hunger and should sleep hungry is now billionaire and that’s called success + revenge. They also later launched many other software.</p>
            <p>Like in every field there are competitors like in football there are Messi and Ronaldo, in mobile company there are Apple and Samsung. Similarly, in chatting there is Viber and WhatsApp. But they both are user-friendly application for chatting they only main problem of Viber is many ads runs on the interface of Viber but in WhatsApp no ads run on the interface that makes it more user-friendly. WhatsApp is used by everybody either children or old ages. The main fact that people love WhatsApp is it is user friendly with users and its interface in simple and doesn’t promote any ads in the home interface.</p>
            <p>From the biography of Jan Koum, we knew that success is not available only you are from a wealthiest family and success doesn’t comes without any effort. You need to give your 110% to achieve your aimed goal. At the beginning of WhatsApp, little number of users were there and Jan was about to give up, thanks to Brian so that today we are using a great application for doing chat. From this part we can say that we need to keep a patience for getting a good result. </p>
